This code defines two main classes, Laboratoire and Universite, to manage research laboratories and their researchers. 
The Laboratoire class stores information such as the laboratory name, the list of researchers, the overall H-index, and the laboratory category. 
It includes methods for adding and removing researchers, sorting researchers by H-index, and updating the laboratory category based on the H-index. 
The Universite class manages a list of laboratories and provides methods to add laboratories, as well as to add and remove researchers in a specific laboratory. 
Exception classes (ChercheurDejaExistant, ChercheurNonExistant) and comparator classes (CompH_Index, CompLabH_Index) are also defined to facilitate the management of researchers and laboratories.
